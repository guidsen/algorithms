# Algorithms
A collection of great algorithms that I've written myself for learning purposes. I love to learn new algorithms and keep developing myself.

In this repository I collect all the algorithms I've practiced to be able to share and write about it in the near future.

Currently planned algorithms to learn:

**Shortest Path:**
- [x] [Bellman-Ford](https://github.com/guidsen/algorithms/blob/master/bellman-ford.js)
- [ ] Dijkstra

**Data Structures:**
- [ ] Binary Search Tree (auto-balancing)
